# can't compile Drmc plugin as user www-data

#   workaround: use the ansible user (become: no) (temporarily change permissions of the dir. to allow this)
#     Note: a previous version of the role changed dir owner to ansible_ssh_user instead of changing perms, 
#           but broke with ansible 2  (ref  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/13982)
